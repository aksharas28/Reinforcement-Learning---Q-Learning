# Reinforcement-Learning---Q-Learning
A reinforcement learning agent is built to navigate the classic 4x4 grid-world environment. In this  project, the agent has learnt an optimal policy through Q-Learning which will allow it to take actions  to reach a goal while avoiding obstacles. Key components of the Q-Learning algorithm are implemented and explained. Specifically, tabular Q-Learning approach is used which utilizes a table  of Q-Values as the agentâ€™s policy.
